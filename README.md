# Project_TrailBlAstar
This is the source code of the Trailblazer App, developped for the lecture Software Engineering during my exchange semester at KAIST (South Korea).
The App is designed as navigation app optimized for the KAIST campus. The application has been developed as a group project.
The React Native Framework is used for cross-platform availability.
